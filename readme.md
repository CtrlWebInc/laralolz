## Laralolz

Laralolz is a Laravel PHP framework application which allows anyone to very simply and spontaneously organize outings during conferences, or to join outings created by others. 

The application has been initialized, builded and designed by the [Laravel Montreal community](https://twitter.com/LaravelMtl)

## Why ?

- Because fun shouldn't stop at the end of the conference day.â€‹
- Conferences are as much about community and networking as they are about learning and sharing.
